The usual color palette generators provide few colors which are not usable on their own because proper palette requires many shades. Also, there is a question of choosing right saturation, luminosity etc.. This color palette generator aims to provide harmonius palette, following the example of Tailwindcss framework. Another hickup is when we choose color palette we need to copy it to our CSS framework which can be tedious at times. That's why I have also included configuration code generator for Tailwindcss, Bootstrap (SCSS) and CSS variables. To make life easier. There's more plan for future.</p>

Smal React practice app. I have used Last.fm API to get the top country tracks and artists and Shopify API to provide links to the artists and tracks. Original idea was to get top country domestic artists and tracks, but unfortunatelly Last.fm doesn't or didn't provide that information and Spotify also doesn't have it. For the moment it will stay dormant like this.</p>
