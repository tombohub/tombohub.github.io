Scraping forum with 3+ million posts. It took 2 weeks of 24/7 script running across 4 servers. It required good organization since the forum is closing in 2 weeks. I even had a gantt chart to plan and keep track of the servers. While it was fun to do it, morality prevents me from replicating the old forum.
