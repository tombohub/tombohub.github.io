Small app where user chooses country and it lists top tracks and artists for that country with links to Spotify. I have used Last.fm API to get the top tracks and artists in a specific country and Shopify API to provide links to the artists and tracks. Original idea was to get top artists and tracks in a specific country, but unfortunatelly Last.fm doesn't or didn't provide that information and Spotify also doesn't have it. For the moment it will stay dormant like this.
