Harmonius color palette generator. Modify the color palette of existing frameworks and generate the configuration code. During the developing I realized how hard is to choose proper color palette.
The usual color palette generators provide few colors which are not usable on their own because proper palette requires many shades. Also, there is a question of choosing right saturation, luminosity etc.. This color palette generator aims to provide harmonius palette, following the example of Tailwindcss framework. Another hickup is when we choose color palette we need to copy it to our CSS framework which can be tedious at times. That's why I have also included configuration code generator for Tailwindcss, Bootstrap (SCSS) and CSS variables. To make life easier.
