Displaying stock price chart for each day of the 6 months. Usual way we use stock charts is to have all days in one big chart. This time I wanted to compare daily movements to easilly see if I can spot some recuring patterns. To do that I needed to have all the daily charts side by side, for easy comparison. After testing many chart libraries, only library that was able to reproduce 150 charts on one page was recharts.js. All others were slow so I had to use some kind of lazy loading, fetching in backround and other techniques. Unfortunately, recharts.js doesn&#39;t have candlestick chart.

Soon I realized that emoji parsing can be quite tricky since emojis consists of 2, 3 even 4 characters. But, with the goal in mind (and useful libraries) it is done and it works really well!</p> <a href="https://nightskycomment.com/">link</a>  <a href="https://github.com/tombohub/NightSkyComment">repo</a> </section><section> <a href="/projects/overnight_strategy_weekly_backtest"> <h3>Overnight Strategy Weekly Backtest</h3> </a> <p>
Backtesting of 5000+ stocks for overnight strategy. Creating plots comparing it to benchmarks. There are many stock which
barely make it during the day, but big gains overnight. At least for the last 2 years. Reason is probably because during the night institutions drive the price while during the day many traders, retail as well as institutional, are in play essentially competing with each other keeping the price in a sort of equilibrium. Also, most earnings are announced after the market closes.

Modify the color palette of existing frameworks and generate the configuration code. During the developing I realized how hard is to choose proper color palette.
The usual color palette generators provide few colors which are not usable on their own because proper palette requires many shades. Also, there is a question of choosing right saturation, luminosity etc.. This color palette generator aims to provide harmonius palette, following the example of Tailwindcss framework. Another hickup is when we choose color palette we need to copy it to our CSS framework which can be tedious at times. That&#39;s why I have also included configuration code generator for Tailwindcss, Bootstrap (SCSS) and CSS variables.
