~120.000 DNS requests a day for getting IPs of daily new domains looking for specific IP range and organizing 
into the database. The goal is to realize trends in certain industry and provide the business intelligence info. Problem was categorizing websites. Since there is approximatelly 2000 new websites each day, categorizing them manually would provide require a lot of time. I haven't found any machine learning model which I could use, nor do I have enough knowledge at the moment. 
I will keep on learning in the meantime until I have enough knowledge to automate this task.
