Small app where user chooses country and it lists top tracks and artists for that country with links to Spotify. Smal React practice app. I have used Last.fm API to get the top country tracks and artists and Shopify API to provide links to the artists and tracks. Original idea was to get top country domestic artists and tracks, but unfortunatelly Last.fm doesn't or didn't provide that information and Spotify also doesn't have it. For the moment it will stay dormant like this.
