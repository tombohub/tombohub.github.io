Create starry night sky comment from emojis. Good for posting on social media, especially Instagram. I have created this for my beautiful girlfriend once she saw the starry comment on instagram. Seeing that she was copying the comment and replacing with their own emojis I have decided to make her life easier and create this small app. Or so I thouhgt so. Soon I realized that emoji parsing can be quite tricky since emojis consists of 2, 3 even 4 characters. But, with the goal in mind (and useful libraries) it is done and it works really well!
