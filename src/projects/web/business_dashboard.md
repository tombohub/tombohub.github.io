Dashboard for small private business. To keep track of the sales and inventory from multiple places.
The owner has a multiple physical places of sales, along with the inventory. Since marketing parnter provides sales dashboard, but it's rather user unfriendly and hard to keep track I have build this one custom for the owner to scrape the sales info and adjust the inventory. It saves a lot of time. 
Custom made, not open to public.
