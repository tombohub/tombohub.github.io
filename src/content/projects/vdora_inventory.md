Scraping the sales from the business partner's dashboard and updating the inventory in Google Sheets. The owner used to do manual updating of the inventory in the Google Sheets by looking at his account dashboard provided by marketplace. It was tedious and time consuming. This script scrapes the sales from dashboard and updates the Google Sheet. Saves a lot of time.
