Classified ads website targeted only to local neighbourhood. Vanilla Javascript real time chat
implemented. In one building can live thousands of people which creates a mini-market. Goal is to have in-house classifieds so people can easily trade with their neighbours. It elevates the community spirit.
This is my first Django application.
